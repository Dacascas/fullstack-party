# Great task for Great Fullstack Developer

## Few simple requirements

- Design should be recreated as closely as possible.
- Design must be responsive. Because we live in our smartphones and we will check with them for sure.
- Use GitHub V3 REST API to receive data. [Docs here](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
- Use popular PHP framework (SlimPHP, Lumen, Symfony, Laravel, Zend or any other)
- Use AngularJS or ReactJS.
- Use CSS preprocessor (SCSS preferred).
- Browser support must be great. All modern browsers plus IE9 and above.
- Use a Javascript task-runner. Gulp, Webpack or Grunt - it doesn't matter.
- Do not commit the build, because we are building things on deployment.

# Recommendation for local adaptation

For use this code you should have created in github account and clone this branch to local computer 
and create in local computer virtual host with name test (http:/test).
Need to create next folders /cache and /var/log with full access (chmod 777 /var/log)
